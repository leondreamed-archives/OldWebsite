  <h1>Redesign! - June 7, 2019</h1>
  <p>I&rsquo;m estatic to tell you about the new website layout! The major focus on this update was to make the site much more maintainable in terms of the file structure. This allows me to provide better user experience for you in terms of reducing likelyhood of subtle bugs, glitched displays, etc. I&rsquo;ve also created a generally better looking layout (although admittedly not as appealing as others) that may help with navigation and give this site a cleaner interface in general so that you don&rsquo;t need to cringe as much when you visit it.</p>
  <p>Accounts have been temporarily removed (although I do admit that there was really nothing you could do anyways). However, they will return with new account-only features (e.g. comments, profiles, etc.) that can help make the site much more personalized and customizable for your likings.</p>
  <p>Do expect bugs and heavy maintence work for the next few weeks, but I&rsquo;ll hopefully be able to refine it to further perfection for your benefit!</p>
  <p>Thanks for sticking with me and I hope that you like the new redesign!</p>
