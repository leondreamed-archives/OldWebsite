  <h1>Working on (another) redesign!</h1>
  <p>Thomas Frank introduced my to Typora a while back, and it's now one of my favourite apps. If you've never heard of it, it's a live markdown editor that allows you to edit and preview text in one minimalist window.</p>
  <p>So, what does Typora have to do with my new redesign? To put it simply: "Markdown is much more edit friendly than HTML".</p>
  <p>I've realized that there exists a lot of friction between me and pushing out the latest article. There are still a lot of steps I have to follow to ensure that my articles go public.</p>
  <p>I'm working on a tool that would allow seamless transition between a markdown file and a live article. I know that tools such as WordPress exist, but I would love to practice and sharpen my programming skills by building a similar tool of my own. I'll also admit that I suffer from NIH (<strong>N</strong>ot <strong>I</strong>nvented <strong>H</strong>ere) syndrome.</p>
  <p>The other reason I'm redesigning is because I don't want to focus so heavily on React (even though it is amazing) because I don't like the FOUC (<strong>F</strong>lash <strong>O</strong>f <strong>U</strong>nstyled <strong>C</strong>content) before my site fully loads.</p>
  <p>This redesign will take some time (especially since I've got a ton of projects and challenges in queue), but I can ensure that my articles will still come out on a regular (hopefully weekly) basis.</p>
  <p>Thanks for sticking with me through the young stages of my website!</p>
  <h1>New Announcements Feature! - June 30, 2019</h1>
  <p>Here's your new feature of the month (just in for the summer school streams, too)! This feature uses the Twitter API to transform my Tweets into announcements that you can view on my website. Of course, you could just go directly to my Twitter account, but some people have Twitter blocked because of its distracting potential or don't want to scroll through irrelevant Tweets (for I will be posting more than just announcements on Twitter). Whatever the reason, I hope you enjoy and find this new feature useful especially for the days to come (as I will be using the announcements to announce stream times, progress updates, etc.)!</p>
  <h1>Redesign! - June 7, 2019</h1>
  <p>I'm estatic to tell you about the new website layout! The major focus on this update was to make the site much more maintainable in terms of the file structure. This allows me to provide better user experience for you in terms of reducing likelyhood of subtle bugs, glitched displays, etc. I've also created a generally better looking layout (although admittedly not as appealing as others) that may help with navigation and give this site a cleaner interface in general so that you don't need to cringe as much when you visit it.</p>
  <p>Accounts have been temporarily removed (although I do admit that there was really nothing you could do anyways). However, they will return with new account-only features (e.g. comments, profiles, etc.) that can help make the site much more personalized and customizable for your likings.</p>
  <p>Do expect bugs and heavy maintence work for the next few weeks, but I'll hopefully be able to refine it to further perfection for your benefit!</p>
  <p>Thanks for sticking with me and I hope that you like the new redesign!</p>
