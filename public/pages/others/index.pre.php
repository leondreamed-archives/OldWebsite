<h1>Ongoing Challenges</h1>
<p>For accountability purposes, I've created some challenges with friends for extra motivation on certain tasks. Here is a list of my currently ongoing ones:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://bit.ly/ZaLionMonthlyChallenge">MonthlyChallenge</a> - Inspired by a similar undertaking by a friend, my MonthlyChallenge is a spreadsheet where I add one new task every month (which I have to complete every day) while continuing to complete the older ones as well. <strong>Stakes: </strong>Deliberate failure costs me $50.</li>
  <li><a href="https://habitica.com/profile/ab2b6028-9193-4ad6-85a6-96dadbecfe03">Inn-Free Habitica</a> - Habitica is a cool habit-tracking app that's built like a game to give you extra motivation. One of these motivators was having the consequence of damaging your friends' characters when you didn't complete your tasks. I found myself abusing the 'sleep in inn' feature that allowed this damage to be cancelled, hence the creation of this challenge. <strong>Stakes: </strong>$5 to whoever is first that catches me sleeping in the inn (must be part of my party).</li>
  <li><s><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/LeonZaLion">Duolingo</a> - After putting off my learning of Esperanto for quite some time, my friend recently started learning Dutch on Duolingo. I took this as a good opportunity to challenge myself to get back on track on learning a language that I'm passionate about. <strong>Stakes: </strong>$5 if I don't get 2000XP (for now) by the end of the week.</s><br/>
  <strong>Failed:</strong> 2000XP required too much time commitment. End result? Neither of us managed to reach 2000XP and forgot about this challenge. XP used to be skill-based, but now it's time-based (spend more time = get more XP).</li>

</ul>

<h1>Tools</h1>
<h2>Created By Me</h2>
<p><a href="/tools/term-translator/index.php">Term Translator</a> - Honestly, quite an underwhelming name for such a powerful (and useful!) tool. This tool allows for creation of nicely formatted translations that one can import into memorization software (e.g. as flashcards for Anki).</p>
<h2>Recommended By Me</h2>
<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> - An absolutely amazing software that uses spaced repetition to help create an extremely powerful tool for memorization. It's free on PC, Android and anywhere with an internet connection. The iOS app, however, does cost $35 (which I gladly paid for and don't regret at all), but the help it can provide with memorizing terms (e.g. french vocabulary) is completely worth the time and money.</p>
