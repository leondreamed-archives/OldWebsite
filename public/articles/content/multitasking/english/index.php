<p><strong>Multitasking:</strong> The performance of multiple tasks at one time.</p>
<p>A great way to describe multitasking is thinking about how a computer is able to multitask. Nowadays, computers have many cores so that they can truly multitask by having different operations running on separate cores. However, one core can only run one process at a time. As such, if we turn to a computer with only one core, we still find that you can have many processes running at the same time even on one core. There are several jobs being run, but they aren&rsquo;t <strong>concurrent:</strong> <em>operating or occurring at the same time.</em> Rather. the core of the computer is switching between these two or more processes and creates the illusion of multitasking. A computer may be able to do this without struggle, but unfortunately, our brains and computers&rsquo; brains aren&rsquo;t created equal. While a computer is able to quickly switch between tasks with little to no consequence, our brains don&rsquo;t work as flawlessly when we try to &lsquo;multitask.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To find out the reason why humans can&rsquo;t multitask with as much success computers do, we need to uncover the element that&rsquo;s stopping us from doing so. A keyword comes into play here: <strong>focus.</strong> Due to our single-core processor brain, we can only focus on one thing at a time. Trying to focus on two things simultaneously isn&rsquo;t possible but rather you would quickly (try to) focus on one and then the other back-and-forth really quickly. In doing so, one loses momentum in their first task when they switch to the other. This is known as the <em>cognitive switching penalty.</em> In switching to the other task, their brain must now use up time and effort to try and enter a deep state of focus for this task, which doesn&rsquo;t come immediately. By switching between two or more tasks frequently, your focus state will forever stay shallow because your brain won&rsquo;t have enough time to enter &lsquo;deep focus mode&rsquo; for any of your tasks and you lose a large amount of efficiency in trying to get your work done. Another issue with multitasking is <strong>attention residue,</strong> which kicks in when you have already swapped to another task but still think about other tasks you&rsquo;ve switched from. This is likely to occur often in a shallow state of focus and it greatly diminishes the amount of concentration and productivity limited by your thoughts on a different topic while working on another. Some of these residual thoughts can include curiosity from not knowing what happens next (e.g. watching shows, videos, etc.), or forgetting about something after a task-swap (e.g. telling friends about something important, forgetting to turn off the stove, etc.).</p>
<p>Multitasking can also build up anxiety and increase the level of stress. Combining attention residue with a shallow focus, the fast-paced switching, along with facing the consequences of not putting enough focus on one of your multitasking tasks, one begins to realize that multitasking has a great potential for building up large amounts of stress.</p>
<h3>How to avoid Multitasking</h3>
<p>Now that you know that multitasking isn&rsquo;t always for the better, how can one avoid this temptation, especially when there&rsquo;s a lot of things that need to be done?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Filtering/Prioritizing:</strong> Before tackling all these tasks on your To-Do list, it&rsquo;s extremely important to really understand that we only have so much time in a day. By filtering out tasks aren&rsquo;t really worth our limited time compared to others, we can save a lot of stress and a lot of motivation when we don&rsquo;t (inevitably) fail to do all these things. As well, time is often not on our side and prioritizing the more important things first is crucial in creating an effective schedule. The opposite of concurrent work is sequential work, which for the most part is what we&rsquo;re aiming for. However, this also means that we want to make sure that we switch as little as possible (we aim to finish one task or at least get a sufficient amount done before moving on to the next) so that we reduce as much attention residue and the cognitive switching penalty as we can.</li>
<li><strong>Estimation:</strong> A big part of scheduling your day sequentially is making sure that you understand how you estimate your productivity. One who is able to more realistically estimate the time they need to complete a task will end up more efficient and productive in the end. As Parkinson&rsquo;s Law states (that work expands to fill the time allotted for it), overestimating can often lead to wasted time (which is something that you especially do not want when you&rsquo;ve got a mountain of tasks stacked up on your list). Underestimating time is also an issue because it means that you will have less time to do your other tasks. Relating this back with prioritization, if this underestimation ends up costing you too much time and leaving not enough for a mandatory task afterward, combining your increased stress with time ticking away quickly, the task&rsquo;s work quality will inevitably diminish as well.</li>
<li><strong>Allocating:</strong> When you&rsquo;ve got the basic structure of your schedule, it&rsquo;s also important to allocate buffer time to small things that we often overlook. Such things include potential exceptions, estimation errors, travel time (switching from one task to another), etc. It&rsquo;s important to make sure that you give yourself some time to transition to further distance yourself from the potential of stress causing you to take more time to finish a task. Allocation is also important for tasks where a rock-hard stop time may not be the best idea. A great example from my own life is when I&rsquo;m in the middle of debugging a bug in my program and end up being really, really reluctant to leave it off for a later time because of the fear of not being able to get my thinking process back immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Grouping:</strong> Now that you understand the tasks you can accomplish for your schedule, the strategy of grouping is something that is often underappreciated for the efficiency of your day. You can split tasks into two categories: high-intensity and low-intensity. Examples of high-intensity tasks include studying for a test, working on homework, or <em>actively</em> reading a book. Low-intensity tasks include checking your email, finishing up a letter, or other small things that don&rsquo;t require a lot of brainpower. By grouping these low-intensity tasks into one batch of time in your schedule, your brain can get all of them done easily as it doesn&rsquo;t need to switch frequently between high-intensity tasks and low-intensity tasks which can end up with wasted and inefficient management of brainpower. Another important aspect of grouping your tasks this way is to try and make your batch of low-intensity tasks on a time period in your schedule where your brain is not the most active. For some people, this time of day may be right after they wake up and for others, it might be before they go to bed. By putting this time slot in a time where you aren&rsquo;t really as productive as you can be, you can plan out your day more efficiently and don&rsquo;t need to spend as much time either doing a high-intensity task with little brainpower or wasting brainpower by doing a low-intensity task with a lot of brainpower.</li>
<li><strong>Sticking/Readjusting:</strong> One flaw that I experience with schedules is that I often end up not really following the schedule I make. This is partly due to a lack of self-control but can also be attributed to simply not having the correct/exact time slots available (e.g. coming home a bit late, taking longer to eat dinner than expected, etc). The problem with missing these benchmarks is the issue of losing motivation because you&rsquo;ve already failed to stick to your time slot and you end up trying to multitask to either make up for the time you&rsquo;ve lost or you just give it all up. Sticking to your schedule comes into play when you think that all is lost because of a simple time loss. Readjusting involves handling the situation appropriately in ways such as giving less time to a less important part of your day. It&rsquo;s often not the best idea to multitask to get back your time, for you may end up losing a lot more than if you were to simply just stick to your schedule as much as possible and readjust your schedule intelligently.</li>
<li><strong>Jot ideas/tasks down:</strong> I recently purchased a wristwatch that can record your voice at the flip of a switch. The reasoning behind this was to have something that I could rely on for capturing ideas that I, at the time of recording it, could not start working on at that time. It has been incredibly helpful for small things such as reminders but can play an even bigger role when it comes to avoiding multitasking. Attention residue will inevitably occur, even if you only have one task for your whole day. As such, when an idea pops into your head relating to a task that you don&rsquo;t want to think about, jotting your thoughts down calms your brain&rsquo;s anxiety from worrying that you&rsquo;ll forget about your thoughts. Of course, you don&rsquo;t need to spend too much money for a device like mine; a phone with a notes app would be fine as well. However, I have found that this wristwatch recording device has been more effective for me because it&rsquo;s almost always easily accessible at any time, where (unlike most people) I don&rsquo;t always have my phone on me and ready to record a thought.</li>
</ol>
<h3>When Multitasking is OK</h3>
<p>Of course, we are always multitasking (that&rsquo;s how we need to survive!). We breathe, we think, etc. Well, some people may not consider these &lsquo;tasks&rsquo; as true tasks, but the point I&rsquo;m trying to get across is that some of our tasks don&rsquo;t require much attention to get a sufficient amount of value from them. For example, I like to study with Anki on my phone while I walk to school. The task of walking doesn&rsquo;t require much of my focus and leaves a lot of focus for actually studying my flashcards. However, when I cross the street, I now have to pay much more attention to my surroundings and must switch my focus back to walking. This sense of multitasking is OK to do because for me, studying with Anki doesn&rsquo;t really require a deep mode of study (when I&rsquo;m not trying to cram), which allows me to switch between it with little cognitive switching penalty. Also, because I&rsquo;m not crossing the street every minute, I don&rsquo;t have to switch between tasks often which still allows my mind to have enough focus on my Anki flashcards so that I get value from studying them while I trek to school.</p>
<p>Another time we can &lsquo;multitask&rsquo; is when we&rsquo;re stuck on a part of a subject (for me, a bug whose solution I can&rsquo;t find). One way to deal with this problem is by simply keeping it in the back of your head while you do something else that doesn&rsquo;t require a heavy amount of focus. For example, I find that the solutions to these bugs can come to me when I take a walk outside instead of staring in frustration at my computer screen. Taking a walk outside doesn&rsquo;t directly relate to finding the solution to my problem, but by distancing myself from the frustration and stress I experience when I&rsquo;m actively debugging the program and not getting anywhere, solutions can tend to arise when the bigger picture comes into mind. Of course, it&rsquo;s important to note that this wouldn&rsquo;t work when you try working on a task that requires a lot of focus. Attention residue will bring poor quality and slow progress in your new task. By keeping attention residue out of the equation because it doesn&rsquo;t really affect a &lsquo;task&rsquo; where you don&rsquo;t need to put in a lot of brainpower, you can use it to your advantage by tackling the task in a new perspective.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>All in all, multitasking is often misused and given a bad reputation because of this. If used correctly, multitasking has the potential to make your day flow smoother and even become more productive. One can also make their schedules more effective by examining some of the flaws with not multitasking properly and build their schedules around these traps. The important key-point to take home is that humans may be able to multitask but can&rsquo;t &lsquo;multi-focus,&rsquo; so it&rsquo;s up to them to split up their focus for different tasks effectively.</p>
