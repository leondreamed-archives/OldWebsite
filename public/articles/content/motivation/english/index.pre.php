<p><em>"Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough."</em> - Og Mandino</p>
<p>Motivation - <em>the act or process of providing something that causes a person to act</em></p>
<p>In this quote, motivation is the "strong determination to succeed." Without a motive, there would be no reason to have determination, for the definition of determination is to achieve a desired end. With no end in mind (i.e. purpose), you can't have determination. So, filling in our new definition, we have: "Failure will never overtake me if my motivation is enough." We can even rephrase this quote: "When motivation is enough, one will not fail."</p>
<p>I assume that nobody wants to fail. In this case, failure is defined as not achieving your goal. (If your goal is to fail, success, for you, is to fail...) I also assume that people have a motive behind reaching their goal (for without a motive in mind, motivation will be very hard to come by. Sometimes, the motive is often very hard to pin down, so don't just give up because you can't find a concrete reason for your goal). Now, if nobody wants to fail, and people genuinely want to succeed, why don't they?</p>
<p>The answer often lies in a lack of motivation, in other words, the value of the outcome becomes of less worth in the present than not actively trying to reach it. Obviously, failure is unwanted, but when the reward is so far away, it almost seems unreachable and in the present time, motivation can be lacking and you may not find enough worth to achieving your goal when the motive for it is based on a distant reward. You've probably heard a few times that our brains are wired to think about the present, and that we will often value the short-term rewards over the long-term rewards. This situation is a classic example of such sayings.</p>
<p>It may be possible to continue on with willpower alone, but the issue is that with pure willpower and a lack of motivation, the quality of work tends to deteoriate, and you start lacking a reason to produce quality work.</p>
<p>So, now the question lies in getting this motivation. I've brainstormed some ideas (which may or may not be applicable depending on your goal), and I've expanded on my thoughts with each one:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add to your current reward</strong> - As our motivation tends to wane the further/weaker our reward (the main motive) gets, by strengthening this part of the motive, we can give our stubborn brain more reasons to keep going on our journey to our goal. There are a boatload of apps/tips you can use to boost the reward and give the motive a higher value, and one app that I use is Habitica, a gamified task-manager that makes doing your tasks fun. The rewards come in when you finish your tasks, providing your character with gold, experience, and even help damaging a boss. These are plenty more ways to give yourself more rewards and in turn more motivation, but I'd like to talk about a more interesting way next...</li>
<li><strong>Increase the pain of failure</strong> - Referring back to the quote that I started this article with, failure will never get to you if you're determined enough to succeed. And sometimes, the motive for succeeding can come from avoiding the failure. Your brain is extremely good at justifying what it wants to do in the present time, and by putting yourself in a position where failing will be painful (not neccessary physically painful...but that's still a valid route). Examples of increasing the punishment include losing things you value, getting put to blame, etc. For me, Habitica also brings a punishment for failure, and that comes from battling bosses with my friends in our party. The motivation for avoiding failure comes from knowing that if I don't do what I'm supposed to do, my friends will take damage because of me. I also use another app for this purpose, Beeminder, which is an app that charges you money for not doing the things you said you were going to do. The motive for Beeminder is pretty self-explanatory (I'm pretty sure that nobody wants to lose their money...right?), and combined with Habitica (especially preventing me from staying in the Inn) creates a very powerful motivation tool.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce the friction towards reaching your goal</strong> - Before I expand on this idea, I think it's best to define 'friction.' To me, friction represents something standing in your way that will require extra willpower/effort to continue along your path to your goal. For example, if my goal was to write x number of words every day, an example of friction could be if I had a terribly slow computer, and I had to wait a long time before my writing program would load. The extra seconds may be enough for my brain to tell me that I can just get it done later, or maybe even worse, postpone it to tomorrow! Some ideas for friction reduction in this particular example would include writing words out, keeping the writing window open or even switching to a different (perhaps faster) writing application. It's often best to not leave time for your brain to think about doing something that you know that you should be doing. As I've said before, your brain is an absolute champion at justifying decisions, even when you know they're wrong, so by reducing the amount of time your brain gets to start its justification, you give yourself a higher likelihood of progressing on your goal.</li>
<li><strong>Make your arching motive clear and justified</strong> - It's probably impossible for many of us to have zero friction, so by making sure that you keep your motive clear at all times (e.g. perhaps keeping a note on your wall), you can fight back when your brain tries to explain why it would be better not to work on your goal in the present. Another idea, perhaps would include reminders that don't include your sight (e.g. an audio recording that plays when you try to get up in the morning).</li>
<li><strong>Keep something to keep you going:</strong> You will always need something that's keeping your back and preventing your from falling into the rabbit hole of demotivation, for willpower cannot be infinite. <em>"[T]here is one longing–almost as deep, almost as imperious, as the desire for food or sleep–which is seldom gratified. It is what Freud calls "the desire to be great." It is what Dewey calles the "desire to be important.""</em> <strong>- Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People.</strong> Make your progress important, even if it's only for yourself. There are many ways of doing this. You could make your progress public (e.g. making your class notes public), or you could keep the importance of what you want to accomplish always available for access (linking back to my motive point earlier). Don't rely on willpower alone, for even the strongest men in the world can't lift forever. However, you can greatly increase the time you stay standing with encouragement and giving your task a feeling of importance to it. From there you will find that you will need less willpower to get them done, as well as improving other important things like consistency and quality in your work.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency/Moderation</strong> - You probably won't succeed if one day you told yourself that you would start meditating for an hour a day, when you never bothered about it before. You may succeed for a few days but it's likely that after a while, you'll end up making excuses and the snowball effect kicks in, and one missed day turns into a weekload of excuses. By the end of it all, you're disappointed you didn't match your standards. In this case, perhaps shooting for the moon isn't your best bet. By making sure that your goal stays in small increments that you can manage, so that your motivation doesn't dip into the gutter when you've failed to reach your otherwise high standards. Consistency (for most goals) is also important to keep in mind. By making sure that you do something regularly, you create a consistent schedule that keeps progressing towards your end goal, and you will also make sure that progress doesn't get hindered or even reversed when you've ignored a goal for some time.</li>
<li><strong>Create a clear path/plan</strong> - Without a strict schedule, we often waste time deciding on what to do. And believe it or not, these times actually eat away at our willpower, because the act of deciding what to do next itself is something that takes thought and can often lead to wasted time. By keeping with you a path to reach your goals, and knowing what to do next, you eliminate the need to have to think about the next thing to do, and can focus on keeping your progress towards your goal consistent.</li>
<li><strong>Make your plan of action specific</strong> - We oftentimes end up with a generic goal, such as 'Get better grades.' It's oftentimes better to specify exactly what we want to improve to get such grades, such as 'Study for an hour every day.' This goal gives you something to work with, and you can perhaps make it more specific and perhaps a better use of your time like reviewing a specific subject you're struggling with instead of reviewing any subject for a day (this ties in with efficiency, and is a good way to get good grades while studying less...<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Steps-Earning-Awesome-Grades-Studying/dp/1517004446">have I heard that somewhere before?)</a></li>
<li><strong>Make your goal as accessible as possible</strong> - This point is closely associated with the one above. What I mean by this is to make progress towards the goal as attainable at any time as possible. For example, a goal to write 500 words/day is more in your control than to get 500 subscribers in a month. Like the point above, having a specific goal that's in your grasp will lead to these positive outputs (e.g. Producing a video every week is something that you have control over and can work towards getting more subscribers as a result).</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you gained at least one new idea to help you succeed on your goals, and as I come up with more ideas, I'll add them here. If you have an idea that you don't see here, feel free to send it to me and share it with others! So now, instead of trying to find all these hacks to make your goal attainable, actually go and proceed, take action! <em>"If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done."</em> - Bruce Lee</p>
