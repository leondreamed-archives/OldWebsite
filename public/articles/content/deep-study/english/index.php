<p><em>&ldquo;To acquire knowledge, one must study; but to acquire wisdom, one must observe.&rdquo;</em><strong> - Marilyn Vos Savant</strong></p>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>According to Merriam-Webster:</p>
<p><strong>Study:</strong> to read in detail especially with the intention of learning.</p>
<p>In my opinion, studying has been misassociated with last-minute cramming. However, especially regarding the field of self-education, studying should focus more on learning the actual subject. As shown in the introductory quote, knowledge is provided by studying, but wisdom is required by &lsquo;observing,&rsquo; or in other terms, studying with the intent of truly learning the material.</p>
<h4>&ldquo;[T]ruly learning the material.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>What do I mean when I say this? I assume we all &lsquo;learn to apply,&rsquo; in other words, we learn to be able to use what we learn in our everyday lives. For most topics, learning doesn&rsquo;t just mean being able to recall, but often rather being able to use what you recall. When I say &lsquo;to truly learn something,&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t refer to simply gaining shallow knowledge in a topic. I don&rsquo;t refer to being able to regurgitate information at the mention of it. Truly learning something means being able to explain the concept in a manner that reflects how you understand the subject (of course, while simultaneously being correct) and being able to apply this understanding in times where it would be beneficial to you. Truly learning involves learning the &lsquo;why and how,&rsquo; not just the &lsquo;what.&rsquo; Of course, there are some specific subjects where we &lsquo;learn&rsquo; by memorizing. Some examples of such subjects include memorizing the capitals of countries or memorizing the elements of the periodic table. I wouldn&rsquo;t consider this as &lsquo;true learning,&rsquo; for I believe true learning encapsulates the concept of explaining the concept based on an understanding. You can&rsquo;t explain capitals of countries in recalling them, but rather by, perhaps, learning the reason behind the choice of such a capital (this broadens the subject), you can explain your understanding of these capitals. Likewise, recalling elements on the periodic table is simply memorization, and so is being able to name elements based on rules and exceptions. Rather, an example of deep studying would involve an understanding of why such names are the way they are, and being able to explain it based on understanding, and not memorization.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, acquiring a true understanding in every subject is an impractical step, because most of us don&rsquo;t want to learn the subjects that we must study for. The motive for learning them is often not worth the time and effort it takes to gain a true understanding/truly learning the material. Instead, memorization is still very applicable to many subject areas, and perhaps I may write a post on this topic in the future. If you came here with the intent of learning how to study better for a subject that&rsquo;s purely shallow learning/memorization without wanting to really learn it, you&rsquo;re in the wrong place. I would much rather recommend an article about memorization because this study article revolves around one major concept/tip: &lsquo;true learning.&rsquo; By already associating a topic in which you consider it to be purely shallow learning without wanting to actually learn it, you already contradict what this article recommends: creating a purpose and turning memorization into interest.</p>
<h3>Creating a Purpose</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned motivation quite a few times in my articles. However, I can&rsquo;t stress enough that you can&rsquo;t go on with a lack of motivation. You wouldn&rsquo;t follow a path that you know will lead to a dead-end or something even worse. Motivation is your driving force.</p>
<p>Having said that, by creating a purpose, you conjure up motivation. By fulfilling this requirement, you make studying less of a chore. By granting a task with a value from completion, you give more reason to put more effort into the task. If studying was proven to make little to no difference for a test, most people would choose not to study. The sad thing is...shallow studying does make little to no difference, yet so many of us indulge in this bad practice. Scanning the slides or quickly flipping through your notes does very little to aid you in terms of preparing for the test...which is what studying is meant for in the first place. However, if studying could make a large difference but required a lot of effort, more of us would be willing to put in this extra effort to get more out of it. However, taking a look at the study habits of most prove otherwise. Most of us often engage in shallow studying, and deep study is rare to come by. We often get caught up in trying to study and do something else at the same time which effectively destroys any intent of getting any deep understanding from studying. The reason for this bizarre outcome is because the more uncertain a future reward is, the less likely we are to put effort into achieving the reward. Especially regarding the topic of studying, uncertainty is definitely a big factor for why most people don&rsquo;t choose to study deeply. The main motive, which is to do well on a test that we&rsquo;re studying for, comes with great uncertainty. There is no concrete requirement checklist that certifies a good grade on said test. This uncertainty is what hinders most of us from pursuing a deep study of our subject.</p>
<h4>Shifting your Motivation</h4>
<p>The lack of concrete criteria is important to observe if our motivation for studying is to do well on a set of problems in which we cannot predict. One potential solution to this issue is by exhaustively memorizing the answers to every possible question, which is extremely infeasible and inefficient. Another may be to memorize the answers to common questions, which may be more efficient, but perhaps infeasible because there are too many possibilities to consider. The best way is to simply grasp a solid understanding of the subject, which is what deep studying strives to do. However, we cannot create a solid understanding from &lsquo;shallow&rsquo; study, which is the form that most end up practicing. The circular issue is that deep studying requires a motive that isn&rsquo;t abstract or has uncertainty in the reward. For many, the effort needed in order for deep studying is not worth a simple good mark, for deep study aims to retain the knowledge past the use for a good grade. This is where shifting your motivation for studying comes into play. By making your motivation to study something more than just a number or a letter, such as perhaps using this knowledge in a greater fashion, you can equip yourself with a motivation that surpasses your simple desires to get it over with and can convince yourself to learn the subject more deeply.</p>
<h3>Practicing Deep Studying</h3>
<p>Before I go into how one can apply deep studying to ace their next text, I&rsquo;d like to point out some ways that aren&rsquo;t deep studying. Memorizing facts without knowing how they work is not deep studying. For example, memorizing the qualities of a type of rock based on its name is not deep studying. Rather, memorizing the qualities of a type of rock based on how they are formed and knowing why that matters to its physical qualities is an example of deep studying and can be taken well beyond just this simple example. Recalling the information based on its syntax is also not deep learning. Memorizing a statistic based on the exact wording does not demonstrate your understanding of the topic, but rather just shows how well you can memorize something. Learning is not about memorizing. We learn to apply. Likewise, repeating the exact same sentence in your head over and over again is not deep studying. You need to understand the concept of the sentence and be able to explain this in more than just one form. This is especially important when a test consists of a long-response section or short answer questions that end in &lsquo;Explain.&rsquo; Oftentimes, you won&rsquo;t be able to simply just paste in all the sentences you memorized about the subject and get a good mark. Rather, you need to show that you understand what these sentences mean, and deep studying accomplishes that. An analogy I like to compare this to is how learning programming is not just copy-pasting code from StackOverflow into your program, but rather understanding exactly what the code does and being able to recall it later instead of searching up the answer once again (which I will admit I&rsquo;m pretty culpable of). Now that you hopefully have a good idea of what deep studying is not, perhaps you can come up with some examples yourself for ways on how to properly study deep. A few tips/ways are listed below:
<ul>
<li><strong>Asking/Answering Questions:</strong> When I say &lsquo;Questions,&rsquo; I refer to the types of questions that require more than just a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo; answer, or a simple fact. These questions are the type of questions that require you to apply your knowledge in a way where you must defend or explain your position on a topic that convinces why your answer is reliable. For example, a bad question for the topic of rocks would be &ldquo;How is an igneous rock formed?&rdquo; This question isn&rsquo;t a good question because it can be summed up in a simple fact that determines if a rock is igneous or not in the first place. Rather, we can turn this question into a good question by asking &ldquo;How does the formation of an igneous rock determine its unique characteristics?&rdquo; With this question, we need to be able to have an understanding of how an igneous rock forms, and connect this to how this formation process affect the characteristics of the rock itself. Broad questions such as &ldquo;What is an igneous rock?&rdquo; should also be avoided, for the answer to this question only requires you to spit out facts. Instead, good questions should involve making connections between these facts, and to do so, a solid understanding of the subject is required.</li>
<li><strong>Connecting Facts:</strong> To expand upon the last point, where good questions involve questions that require more than just spitting out facts, connecting facts is one of the ways this can be achieved. By making connections to different facts about the topic that you know, you form a more solid connection and understanding of the subject that can help you in both recalling something and expanding on it. This skill is most useful in explaining your opinion. It also helps with memorizing things because knowing that a relationship exists between one fact and another can help you recall a related fact after you&rsquo;ve recalled a similar one.</li>
<li><strong>Explaining the Topic:</strong> <em>Explain does not mean state facts.</em> Rather, explaining something involves understanding why those facts are the way they are, and why they matter to the topic. They always say, &ldquo;try explaining your understanding to a person that has zero prior knowledge in the subject.&rdquo; If you can explain something well enough that can make a person new to the subject understand it, you can expect a great mark in areas relating to that subject. However, if you fail to explain why a fact is the way it is, or how it relates to the overall topic, you show a lack of understanding and need to conduct further research on your topic.</li>
<li><strong>Researching the Topic:</strong> If you&rsquo;ve ever played the game of why with someone, where you state a fact and proceed to answer every question of why the other person asks, you will find that there&rsquo;s often a lot that you don&rsquo;t know. Combine this game with access to the internet, and you are able to find out the reasons at the click of a button. Now, play this variation of the game of why with your original topic. You can start with a specific fact, such as &lsquo;Sedimentary rocks take extremely long to form,&rsquo; and expand upon that fact with the question &lsquo;why.&rsquo; Or, you can choose a much broader topic, perhaps a topic where you&rsquo;re likely to need to expand upon, such as &lsquo;There are three main types of rocks,&rsquo; but be wary, for the why game usually stays as broad as the subject matter. When you play this game and you come across a why question where you cannot answer, invite yourself to the rabbit hole that is the internet and browse through page after page of Wikipedia that helps you greater understand the subject, and don&rsquo;t feel rushed to come back. If you find yourself in this rabbit hole, as long as what you&rsquo;re researching is still related to your original topic, it shows that you have interest in the subject, and this is a sign of deep studying occurring.</li>
<li><strong>Review Often:</strong> You should aim to keep an active interest in a subject you want to study deeply. Consistency is a way one can achieve this. Your interest in things you don&rsquo;t do often will eventually wane, especially if you have a motivation that depends on a faraway goal. This is the reason why I love applications such as Anki, where you are able to memorize things by consistently practicing every day. This allows you to stay interested in the subject and reduces the friction needed to start practicing it. You may have heard that starting something is a lot harder than working on it. This is especially true with something that you haven&rsquo;t done for a long time, and that&rsquo;s why reviewing a topic often is needed to be able to secure a beneficial deep study with a subject.</li>
<li><strong>Taking Notes Effectively:</strong> Taking notes is important. It is important enough to deserve its own article. However, the major key with taking effective notes is by writing them in your own words. Not only does this decrease the importance of the syntax and prioritizes the meaning, but it also reflects what you understand about the subject. Efficiency is also important to consider, and if you don&rsquo;t need to go back to the textbook and filter all the unimportant information from it every time you want to review a subject, you can save a lot of time with just pure notes. Of course, these notes aren&rsquo;t for memorizing, but rather to allow you to review the topic without needing to consult a textbook that&rsquo;s filled with unnecessary words.</li>
<li><strong>Learn:</strong> Again, all this talk about deep studying all relates back to one thing: truly learning the material. You need to always keep in the back of your mind that you are doing this for learning it. You are studying deeply to learn the subject. By keeping this thought around, you start to take learning differently. You start studying for the purpose of learning rather than memorization. Don&rsquo;t treat deep studying as just a better way to get better marks. Don&rsquo;t make your learning artificial, but rather study the subject for the pure intent for learning it so that it may benefit you in the long run. If you continually remind yourself that you&rsquo;re just doing it for a good mark, you disrupt the learning process and make it harder for yourself to commit to deep studying. <em>Deep studying is not a hack. It is a process which needs pure intent to learn in order to be effective.</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>Applying Deep Studying</h3>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve heard a rave about deep studying, it&rsquo;s suitable to move on to how one can apply deep studying to study better. As deep studying focuses on learning the material, one will inevitably form a better understanding and can apply this topic better on tests and quizzes. Knowing &lsquo;the why&rsquo; about a concept is much stronger than knowing &lsquo;the what&rsquo;. Studying deeply will help you with knowing how to expand upon a point, and provide the details for backing up a position or a response. By knowing how to get from point A to point B, you can surmise similar ways to get from point A to point C in the same subject area. You can derive new ways from knowing the why and how, and not just the what. An example of applying deep studying on a test would be by knowing the reason behind a math formula and using the same type of reasoning to derive a similar one. In many cases, knowing how to derive a mathematical formula can be a much greater help than just knowing the pure formula itself, because it allows you to use the same kind of logic and understanding for other cases.</p>
<h3>Choose Wisely</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely inefficient to start deep studying everything you want to learn in life. Just like an SSS, deep studying makes the subject stand out by requiring a lot more of your concentration and effort than a normal study session would. As such, you can&rsquo;t guarantee a good mark on every subject just by choosing to learn every subject deeply, for that ruins the whole intent of learning. Rather, deep studying involves you choosing to study to learn the material. Only apply this when you want to learn something, or you know that you&rsquo;ll be able to commit to learning it properly. If not, there are many other tips/hacks to make your studying experience more efficient, but perhaps not as long term as deep studying seeks to find.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.,</strong> if you were a bit disappointed because you wanted to study for a subject you didn&rsquo;t care much about, fear not! I have a lot of articles planned for those types of people (myself included). However, there still are a few tips in this article to take away that you can apply to &lsquo;shallow&rsquo; studying, but do expect a lot more about this very topic in the future!</p>
