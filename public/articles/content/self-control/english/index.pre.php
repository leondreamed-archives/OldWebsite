<p><em>"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."</em> - <strong>Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Self-control:</strong><em> restraint exercised over one's own impulses, emotions, or desires.</em></p>
<p>Self-control is a big topic, especially in the present. With so many stimulations around us (internet, communication, etc.), self-control was never more needed than in society today and has become a very important skill to have.</p>
<p>For this article, I will be focusing on the part of self-control that stops us from doing things that we know will harm us in the long run.
<p>Taking a look at Merriam Webster's definition of this term, we see that it involves stopping yourself from doing three things: impulses, emotions, and desires. I'd like to expand on each topic separately, and talk about ways how each can be managed/dealt with.</p>
<p>Impulses usually occur from familiar habits, such as nail-biting, or knuckle cracking, where you often not even realize/have little time to think about you even performing the action in the first place. A large part of self-control is acknowledging that you are performing a poor action that you wish to stop. The best way to stop these bad habits is to make sure you always realize that you are performing them. You can try to keep yourself accountable, but because of how natural/normal it seems to you, it's hard to catch yourself in the act, and so having friends to help keep yourself accountable is always a good idea. After you've noticed that you've been carrying through with these impulses, you should take time to reflect and to find a root for this habit in the first place. You could think about this like pulling weeds from the ground, simply pulling off the parts you can see won't be enough, you'll need to dig deeper and pull the roots along with the issue. Just like bad impulses, simply stopping yourself might not be enough, and so by digging into the real roots of the habit, you can try solving the real issue that's causing the impulse in the first place. For example, perhaps you bite your nails when you get nervous. You probably can't get rid of nervousness, but what you can do is to find and implement a different solution to this problem. Perhaps you can find a different way to deal with nervousness or even find ways to avoid it by calming yourself. Once you've discovered the root of your problems, the action that you take to change the root will have a greater effect on the habit compared to if your acting directly on the habit itself.</p>
<p>Moving on to the next example of self-control: your emotions. Emotions are a big part of humans and it's unlikely that we're going to be done with them soon. As such, it's extremely important to be able to control your emotions, and/or how to respond to situations. Someone who controls emotions well is likely to become less stressed, more friendly, and perhaps more morally good as a person. Someone who fails to control emotions well could always be on the tip of their toes, aggressive for the wrong reason, and not someone you would want to be around. When dealing with a new subject, it's best to approach it with a positive attitude, and instead of blaming your mistakes on whatever first comes to your mind, it's best to acknowledge that you shouldn't mistakes as a sign of failure and despair, but rather apply to them an optimistic view and to learn from them. Controlling your emotions can also connect/mix into the other parts of self-control, such as controlling your tendency to blame yourself and to lose hope in trying to break bad impulse habits from the impulsive part of self-control. Emotions don't just have to do with the way other people see you, but it's also a major part of yourself, as emotions do form deep inside before they come out. As such, being able to control these emotions with self-control (and I admit, it can be very hard at times!) is an extremely useful skill to have that can be applied to many other parts of your life.</p>
<p>The last term, perhaps the most known struggle with self-control, is <em>desires.</em> I'm sure that the first thing that pops into everyone's mind is the desire to do something fun, or at least, to not be doing something boring (e.g. homework). This is one of the foundations for why we procrastinate, and controlling this desire is very hard to master for many of us. Our brains center around short-term desires, and what we can get out of something in the present. As such, training your mind to value long-term rewards instead of desiring the short-term ones is a very hard skill to develop, as we have evolved with caring about the present back from our cavemen years. I'm sure that we all have had the feeling of doing something when we know we should be doing something else, and that guilt often stays in the back of our heads while we try to perform the task, which can result in poorer quality of the reward. As such, a place to start with controlling your desires is by taking away the guilt at the back of your head, and actually getting the most out of a reward, even if it's simply entertainment from video games. With this, our reward isn't hindered by the guilt, and we end up getting more fun and as such, perhaps stopping sooner to work on the things as our desired reward level has been reached quicker than it would be if we were to play with this thought of wrongdoing in our minds. However, there are often times where our desired reward level is unreasonable compared to what we need to accomplish. For example, it's getting late at night and your desires for entertainment would require you to play until there is not enough time for your homework to be done well, or you to get a good night's sleep (which is very important!). In situations like these, being able to fully say no to our wishes is a crucial skill that many people lack. For me, one of the ways I've dealt with this is to simply go nuclear and completely block these websites, so that my wrong desires must require extra effort to get to (more effort to try to unblock these websites), so that the work needed to get distracted is much greater than the work to simply get stuff done. Some people find that blocking is too extreme, and so another idea that more people can use, although admittedly less effective, is to simply log out of your time-wasting applications so that the effort needed to log back in to waste time is not worth simply doing what you're supposed to. These aren't the only ways to help you control your desires, and I've heard of a myriad of apps that you can use. However, in the end, there are a lot of desires that can't just simply be blocked, or require a lot more distance to completely disconnect from them. These desires are the foundation of the real challenge of self-control, building it up.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you and I know that you can't just wake up one day, and then tell yourself that you're going to control every single impulse, emotion, and desire for the rest of your life and hold up to that promise. Self-control doesn't just magically form whenever you wanted it to, in that case, it wouldn't be a major issue and you probably wouldn't be reading this post. As such, self-control is a skill that needs to be trained and practiced for you to be able to pull it out whenever you need it. Oftentimes, nuclear options don't replace the need to build up this skill, because when the nuclear option of blocking it out is removed (and it's extremely hard for most desires to completely block them out of your life), having no self-control built up will result in the inevitable downfall of following these desires once again.</p>
<p>You may or may not heard of the 30-day cold shower challenge. This is a challenge that is designed to go against your desires that require very little change to your life, by simply not turning the shower dial to 'hot.' Self-control comes from this small change that will lead to an unpleasant result that you will tread through. By bearing the uncomfortable feel of the ice-cold water and fighting against the desire to turn the shower dial back to what you're used to, your self-control kicks in to keep going, and to fight back from giving up. This challenge may sound extremely stupid to many people at first, but these people often forget about the main purpose of this challenge: to train your self-control. You don't build up this skill by simply sitting around all day, living your normal life. You're going to have to do something uncomfortable, and of course, doing something uncomfortable that you don't normally do is...not normally what you would normally do in a day. As such, it makes sense that these exercises would sound stupid because you wouldn't be used to them. Of course, it would be pretty questionable to recommend such a bizarre challenge if I hadn't done it myself. As such, when I heard about it, I decided to give it a shot. After the 30 painful days were over, and as I continued on with my life for some time, I began to realize that my self-control had become stronger, that is, when faced with temptation, I was able to better hold myself back (another change in my day-to-day life was that my showers were now cold since then, because I would feel guilty taking a hot shower). It's important to mention that of course, this isn't the only way to improve your self-control. By going against your desires, impulses, and emotions every day, even for a little bit, do you then begin to really train your self-control and can withstand temptations more than you could before. Sadly, you're still going to be as vulnerable to these wishes if you just read about self-control, but never act upon the suggestions, or explicitly try to train yourself bit by bit every day. By living in the comforts of life, you will succumb to those whose long term rewards are blinded by your bias for the short-term ones. As such, strong self-control will remain an important skill to have and to develop it, you're going to have to, unfortunately, face the uncomfortable things which your unreasonable desires are trying to shield you from.</p>
