<p>I wrote a post about motivation a while ago and listed some tips on how to gain more motivation to tackle a task that you don't necessarily want to do. You may have heard me rave about motivation way more than I should've of. And yet, you also see me complain about my lack of motivation during these recent days.</p>
<p>Am I giving all these tips on how to stay motivated yet fail to give myself enough motivation at the same time? Am I complaining about not having motivation when there's a whole article that <em>I wrote</em> about this very topic?</p>
<p>I'll be honest, I have tried to use the tips I provided in my own life. However, many of these tips are shadowed by what this article would like to talk about. Motivation killers can often end up reversing all your progress from motivators. Here are a few examples of these motivation killers from my own life:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adding to my reward:</strong> I provided the example of Habitica for this topic. I still believe that it has the potential to give many a lot of motivation. However, these rewards simply weren't enough to motivate me at times where motivation killers had seeped all my energy away and left me in an extremely vulnerable state for failure to overtake me. Perhaps my mistake was not giving myself a bigger potential reward for completing my tasks, but I think that these rewards were shadowed by an even more flawed motivator:</li>
<li><strong>Increasing the pain of failure:</strong> I used two apps to strengthen this motivation concept: Habitica and Beeminder. Beeminder charges you money for not doing your tasks, and Habitica punishes your party members when you don't finish your duties. This also prevented me from staying in the inn when I didn't feel like doing anything that day. However, motivation killers are strong enough to 'help' me find a way around it, and I would create fake dailies and check those off because I didn't want to have to pay. You may think that I'm a terrible person for lying, and that's not far from the truth. In the end, there were days where I forgot to do this and I ended up paying more than $20 (although in reality, it should've been upwards of $50). In the end, I archived the task because it really wasn't helping much; the punishments weren't enough to motivate me to do what I needed to finish, and losing money at the same time wasn't beneficial either...</li>
<li><strong>Making your arching motive clear and justified:</strong> No...I didn't do this. I thought I would be able to just remember in the back of my head that my task was worthy enough to do...but motivation killers absolutely steal this motive and replace it with the worst of excuses that seem extremely justified in the short-term. If you've seen my Challenge List, you may know that I want to learn a lot of ridiculous stuff. I can seem to justify these things to others when they ask about it but I can't really seem to explain the reasoning behind my plans to myself. This is another classic case where when you are put on the spot by someone else, you can improvise and come up with the weirdest (and sometimes not even truthful) reasons to defend your point so that you don't end up looking like a fool. With yourself, however, is a different story. You can't really be made to look like a fool in front of yourself...and as such, these reasons to do these things suddenly get washed away by these short-term justifications from these motivation killers.</li>
<li><strong>Reducing the friction towards reaching your goal:</strong> When I wrote the motivation article, I was mainly focused on the friction that affected your goal directly. However, I've come to notice that the main friction isn't just something that directly hinders you from putting in an effort to complete your goal but can also include times where you are indirectly affected. Sometimes, it's hard for us to tell what is preventing us from doing something, such as the random feeling of demotivation, or the random hesitation to continue with something. Being unable to locate the source of friction can make a huge impact on both our productivity and our consistency. A reason such as "just not wanting to do it" isn't really a valid excuse and wouldn't really be considered the root cause of friction between you and getting your stuff done. Rather, there are often many root causes that lead up to this big umbrella term of "not feeling like doing something."</li>
<li><strong>Making your arching motive clear and justified:</strong> I didn't really do this as much as I should have. My motive was often washed away by my motivation killers and I would always postpone trying to keep clear and justified reasons ubiquitous around me so that I wouldn't forget the real reason I'm doing this. This is especially important in times of heavy doubt and especially when you don't know where to go from your current situation. Keeping the end goal in mind is extremely important, for many motivation killers target this uncertainty and can often get the better of what you believe in.</li>
<li><strong>Keep something to keep you going:</strong> The failure stemmed from this point was that I didn't really make my tasks seem important. There was really no accountability or encouragement in keeping a task to myself. I've recently made some of my challenges public (e.g. my MonthlyChallenge) and this helps make my work more important and elevates my motivation to do them well. However, you still may notice some failures in these challenges until I added another element of motivation to them (e.g. my $50 pledge, which I'm not taking too seriously, to be honest) which goes to show that just applying one tip is often not enough to combat against these motivation killers.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency/Moderation:</strong> I stumbled across a tip for making sure you don't give up on your habits. This tip was about not making the second mistake. You might eventually, after starting a habit, end up failing for one day. This tip told us to forgive ourselves and keep trying...but to never make that second mistake, to never fail two days in a row. I must admit that I've failed in doing so, for I struggled to stay consistent with many of my tasks. The largest issue stemmed from me telling myself that I could get a task done with later until eventually, I had no time left to finish that task. This stagnated my flow and eventually led to me just failing to care much about that task anymore. Moderation relates to consistency in the sense that doing a little of one thing gives you more time to do another. There were many times where I spent way too much on one task that left not enough time for another, especially when I didn't make a schedule:</li>
<li><strong>Create a clear path/plan:</strong> Ahh...schedules. I love making them but I always seem to discard them. There's always that one thing I don't take into account or that day where I commit to sticking only to find out that exceptions ruin my process. Creating a clear path/plan isn't just related to the task at hand but also how your day will incorporate that task as well. When I followed the schedules I made, my day often went really well and flowed really smoothly. For path/plans relating to the task at hand, an example of a motivation killer for me was not knowing what to write about for my 500 words. This would often lead to me postponing it and wasting time thinking about what to write when there were a lot of gaps in my day I could've spent thinking about it. I just didn't value this enough to do so at the time and ended up regretting it later when I had to write my 500 words late at night. As such, always make sure that you know what you will do to make progress on your goal at all times. Prioritize this to make sure that you never come up with the excuse of not knowing what to do.</li>
<li><strong>Making your plan of action specific:</strong> For some of the broader tasks I have, I often do what I think is the easiest to accomplish. Compare that with my specific 500 words a day challenge, you find that I actually often write a lot more than 500 whereas for broad tasks like "read a French book," I often just read one paragraph and I'm done for the day. This would often lead to me not making much progress on my goals, which is the main motive for having the goal in the first place. If I had made my plan of action more specific, I probably would've progressed more on my 'abstract' goals since I've started them.</li>
<li><strong>Make your goal as accessible as possible:</strong> In my motivation article, I gave the example between writing 500 words/day vs. getting 500 subscribers/day. One goal is much easier to plan and achieve in the sense that you physically can write 500 words and certify that completion, whereas getting 500 subscribers is out of your control. However, there's also the other issue of prioritization of goals and making sure that you do the most limited goals first. An example that I can provide from my own life is practicing the piano for 2 hours. I can only play up until 9:30 PM, meaning that I can start at 7:30 PM at the very latest. However, there are times where I don't think much about this and end up passing 7:30 PM and losing the motivation to play because I know that I wouldn't be able to complete my task anyways. As such, making a schedule where you work on the most limited tasks first makes your goal a lot more accessible and avoids the situation of knowing you can't possibly finish your goal and not progressing at all.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Killers</h3>
<p>You've probably gathered a sense of some examples of motivation killers from reading about how they've destroyed mine. Part of the issue was simply just my lack of willpower to counter these killers, but the other part is not allowing yourself to succumb to them. As such, I'd like to list some examples of motivation killers I've had to deal with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad Work Area:</strong> There were times where I was lazy and didn't want to work at a desk (doesn't help me that I have a portable laptop to carry around). As such, I would often resort to working on the sofa or on my bed. I can relate this to jumping in a foam pit. The initial reaction is that it's going to be amazing but when you jump in and realize you have to get out of it, you use willpower to do so and when you're out you've lost a lot of your energy and motivation. As well as being more healthy, working at a desk provides much greater productivity and efficiency with work than an initially more comfortable area does. You would think that when you fall into the trap for the first time that you would be more likely to avoid the next, but because your brain is terrible at thinking in the long term and reasoning with an 'abstract' (non-concrete) idea (e.g. that working on a sofa would reduce productivity, not guaranteed, especially coming home from a long day), the temptation will often cloud your prior experience.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetfulness:</strong> In my experience, I am a lot more likely to postpone something when I realize that I forgot about it. For example, when I'm working on something late at night and realize that I forgot about my homework or some other task, I am much more hesitant to go do it and make reasons such as "it's too late" that work against trying to get my tasks done. This motivation killer is also what encouraged me to buy a bracelet that can record audio. I have a daily that prompts me to check any audio recording I had recorded on that day (even when I think I have none). This allows me to capture ideas on the spot and make a much more reliable reminder system (as I'm wearing this bracelet for most of my time).</li>
<li><strong>Looking Down:</strong> They say that looking down on a tightrope is bad because it makes you more scared of failing and you get a lot more nervous. Likewise, focusing on the pessimistic possibilities also won't help matters when it comes to your motivation. Knowing that one wrong answer can ruin your life can sometimes work against you, especially when it raises the chance of burnout of breaking down. As such, having an optimistic (but not overly-optimistic) attitude can help with your motivation and reduce the risk of giving up, especially when you have a lot that you need to finish:</li>
<li><strong>Looking at the end:</strong> Referring back to the tightrope example, looking at the end and focusing on how much you have left may also not be the best idea. I can definitely relate to this when I focus on what others have accomplished that shadows what I have done. This is one of the biggest killers of my motivation: looking at someone above me and feeling demotivated at the gap between us. This is why the mindset of 'current level +1' is important if you wish to keep your motivation in learning something that allows for easy access to others who have walked a lot further down the path than you have. Instead of looking at the end of the path and the people who have already got there, you should be focused more on taking another step that will get you closer.</li>
<li><strong>Justification:</strong> It's true that we, as humans, tend to justify our behaviour even when it's known to be wrong. However, constantly justifying your behaviours and justifying the justification will lead you to, inevitably, give up on your goals. As such, you could make a list of all the times where you justified your way out of the effort needed to progress on a task and when you have time to relax and think about this list, you could respond or find a solution to all these justifications you made to weasel out of your goal.</li>
<li><strong>Guilt:</strong> In this case, the guilt that I refer to is the guilt that one feels when they do something that they know they should not be doing. However, always feeling guilty actually doesn't help you that much, for if you're always in a situation where you feel guilty about not getting your tasks complete, guilt is probably not a motivation factor for you. Instead, it can actually kill your motivation. This guilt comes from doing things that we value more than putting effort towards our progress on a task. However, you can only get so much reward from one thing before you get bored of it. Guilt hinders this reward flow and makes it harder to get the rewards from doing something that you shouldn't be doing, ultimately leading you to play for longer and lose motivation at the end of it because of the amount of guilt that's been stacked up. As such, if you really do require a break (and are reasonably able to), go take a 'true break' and make sure that you have allocated time to continue with the process to reach your goal. Take a break to reap its rewards, not to escape from the work needed to reach your goals.</li>
<li><strong>Bad Accountability:</strong> A way that can provide motivation is to have a friend or system keep you accountable. This, however, may lead to trouble when your accountability partner isn't doing their job too well. For the majority of the time, it's usually your fault for not making the system a friendly one. Most people don't live their lives to keep others accountable by always asking them if they've finished what they were supposed to do and constantly reminding them and pushing them to do it. Instead, your partner is there to motivate you because you know that there's a consequence if you don't do your goal, whether that would be disappointment from physical consequences such as my $50 pledge for my MonthlyChallenge. The motivation killer in this scenario stems from when you fail to prepare proper accountability with your accountability partner (e.g. depend too much on them or not giving yourself enough incentive to continue). [Fix]</li>
<li><strong>Poor Sleep & Poor Sleep Schedule:</strong> A lack of sleep often contributes to not having enough energy for the day to get work done. A lack of energy results in both a decrease in productivity and efficiency. A bad sleep schedule can also leech your motivation for the day. For some people, waking up late provides them with less motivation rather than if they were to wake up earlier. In order to both wake up earlier and get enough sleep, a good sleep schedule is very important. There do exist apps such as Sleep Cycle that can help you wake up at a better time so that you wake up in a more energized state, but this doesn't replace getting enough sleep in the first place.</li>
<li><strong>Bad Health:</strong> Health doesn't just have to do with sleep but involves other factors such as screen time and even time spent active. If you're like me, you usually spend most of your day sitting in front of a screen. The only times you get up from your seat would be if you wanted to use the washroom or to go eat. However, continue this bad habit for a longer time period and you begin to notice the negative consequences that arise. For example, before my WBS, I was in the archery club at my school and was pretty good at it. However, after I did the WBS and sat on a chair for around 168 hours over a little more than 2 weeks, I came back to the club and found that I couldn't pull back on the same bow I had been using as easily and my arm would shake from weakness when I pulled back the string. So, bad health can really leave a dent in both your physical capabilities and your mental capabilities, including motivation. Perhaps the most common motivation killer from bad health is red eyes and inevitably having to rest them and waste a lot of time (and suffering pain!) in the process.</li>
<li><strong>Losing Progress:</strong> I'm sure that most of us hate having to redo something we already know we've done before. This is particularly the reason why I like using apps that autosave and working in a clean environment when I'm handling physical projects. I really hate ruining something and then having my 'strive for perfection' attitude force me to fix it (a reason why I absolutely hate working with permanent things and sometimes things that take a lot of effort to fix mistakes, i.e. pencil and paper). Losing progress is a motivation killer associated with generating friction between tasks, such that the motivation and deliberate willpower you need to put into the task starts at a greater y-intercept (initially requires more) which can repel you from starting the task.</li>
<li><strong>Exceptions:</strong> I like to think of exceptions as 'losing potential progress.' It also does lose progress in the sense that it often breaks your schedule and workflow and you are much more likely to wander off and get distracted when your workflow or schedule is broken and you don't know what to do next. Exceptions are a strong motivation killer and as the name suggests, you can't really avoid an exception (in the sense of predicting when it will happen and modifying your schedule around that knowledge) but rather deal with one by deliberately allocating time for making up for the time you lose from these exceptions, or making backup plans for your schedules that you can follow when the first plan doesn't go the way you wanted it to.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Mistakes:</strong> When you fail a goal, you'll probably feel guilty about it. However, a common mistake that many people make is letting this failure get the better of them and causing them to lose motivation in themselves to continue. Rather, mistakes happen once in a while, but repeat these mistakes with the excuse of "having already made them" leads your goal into the failure territory. Instead, forgive yourselves for the first mistake you make, but make sure you never make the same mistake twice in a row, for that shows that your motivation is dropping really quickly and you'll likely give up altogether.</li>
<li><strong>Not Knowing the Next Step:</strong> There are days where I don't make schedules or I've already wandered off track one and lose motivation to continue it (which is something that I shouldn't be doing). I think that I can manage my time well by just thinking of something to do next. What I've found when I think back to these times is that I often waste times either thinking of what other tasks I have to do or deciding what the best thing to do next would be (which ends up heavily biased towards what I want to do at that time period). As such, not knowing the next step of your plan puts you at a vulnerable position to not doing the right thing and can lead to the point of bad time management that leaves your task list unfinished at the end of the day.</li>
<li><strong>Not Having Backup Plans:</strong> Backup plans aren't only for times where you suddenly don't have enough time to go forward with your initial plan (e.g. exceptions) but also when you fail to finish a mandatory task in the time you allotted for it or even when you finish a task early. Backup plans relate to making a good schedule in the sense that a good schedule consists of plans other than your first choice and makes sure that mandatory subjects are prioritized. Needing to fall back on a non-existent backup plan links back to not knowing the next step. As such, to prevent this motivation killer from doing its job, it's always a good idea to invest some time in preparing backup plans in case your day doesn't go the way you wanted it to go (which is actually pretty normal for me...not a good thing).</li>
<li><strong>Expectations:</strong> Going into a task with pessimism isn't always the best choice. It's the opposite of going in with optimism. Having low expectations avoids the disappointment of not reaching those expectations but comes with the burden of not having a motive to do more in the case where you have passed it. Likewise, having high expectations avoids the problem of not having enough motivation to continue on past what you wanted, but carries the burden of knowing that you can't reach those expectations and giving up prematurely. "Shoot for the moon. If you miss, you'll land amongst the stars."<strong> - Norman Vincent Peele</strong> For me, setting high standards work better because I like doing things with minimal effort. I've learned that if I set low expectations, I'll only reach those low expectations. Of course, this may differ from person to person. However, I do strongly believe that you should try and set time boundaries as strict as possible. Parkinson's Law states that <em>"work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion,"</em> meaning that if you underestimate yourself and set a large amount of time aside to finish your goals, you will end up taking all the time needed and end up with a poor efficiency ratio.</li>
<li><strong>Procrastination:</strong> Leaving things until the last minute is a common definition of this term. In many cases, you end up leaving it undone. There have been many occasions where I planned to do a task later in the day and ended up not doing it at all. This lowers my motivation in situations where I had planned to follow a schedule but the act of procrastination had messed it up which led me to give up on my schedule for the day. Procrastination loops to many other motivation killers, such as procrastinating on a mandatory task that causes you to sleep late at night or like my example, leading you to a situation where you no longer know what the next step should be.</li>
<li><strong>Poor Time Management:</strong> There are many aspects of time management that if not handled properly, can lead to motivation killers that will end up eating away at this flaw. Time management includes the proper prioritizing of subjects, allocating an appropriate amount of time for topics and maximizing efficiency in your schedule. Prioritization is important when it comes to the mandatory subjects you need to finish, such as a big project approaching its deadline or something as simple as sleeping early enough. There's the old example of filling a jar with rocks and then sand, where if you first fill it with sand the rocks wouldn't fit. This analogy is a perfect example of why it is important to plan out your day with priority in mind. The Fudge Ratio is a ratio that relates the time you think you can accomplish something and the time that you actually end up taking to accomplishing said thing. For example, if I believed that I could write 500 words in only 5 minutes and I end up taking 10 minutes to do so, my Fudge Ratio would be 2 because it took 2 times longer to finish my task than my original estimate. Finding your Fudge Ratio is important for making sure that you allocate enough time for your tasks so that you don't end up walking into the territory of time where you planned to do something else. As an efficientist, efficiency is key in a good schedule. One tip that I've heard about is grouping low-energy tasks together. Some examples of these types of tasks include checking your email, posting on social media and other tasks that don't require as much brain power as some high-energy tasks. By grouping these tasks and planning to do them at a time where you are least energized (for some people that may be the morning, for others it may be late at night), you can save your brain power for use during the more energized time of the day and get things done quicker and better. Compare this to the alternative where these low-energy tasks were spread across your schedule and you find that you waste your high-energy and motivation states on doing low-energy tasks that effectively lower your motivation and waste your potential energy for doing tasks more suited towards that nature.</li>
<li><strong>Stress:</strong> Stress doesn't just hinder your efficiency, but can eat away at your motivation as well. Perhaps the more known motivation loss from stress is the potential of a burnout, where you simply give up doing your task and can lead to more serious consequences if not handled properly. However, stress also causes your motivation to wane when it seeps to another task of your day. However, this motivation killer can be easily countered with simply taking a break. No, not a break such as playing video games or watching videos, but a break that calms you by removing your concentration and relaxing your mind. Examples would include meditation, taking a walk outside, or even just simply thinking about a different subject for a short while. However, these breaks can also provide the risk of breaking your workflow and will often take up more time than you initially think they would. Breaks are important, don't get me wrong, but avoiding stress altogether is probably the more efficient way to do. The best way to avoid stress is to always have a concrete path in front of you whenever possible. Many motivation killers are based around the blindness when there is no path to follow, so simply avoiding all of these motivation killers that can induce stress and combatting stress itself with this strategy is usually the best way to go.</li>
<li><strong>Time Wasters:</strong> We don't waste time because we want to waste time, we waste time because we don't know how to use it. TIme wasting can range from the time it takes to figure out what to do next, or more commonly, actions such as watching Netflix or playing video games with friends when you didn't intend to. Unintended wastes of time can heavily damage our motivation to proceed with things and are also very hard to stop when you initially fall into the rabbit hole. As well, many of us try to justify it and try to multitask by doing homework and watching TV at the same time, which can create some poor habits if continually practiced. One strategy that I use to counter this killer is going extreme, such as Cold Turkey that blocks YT altogether. Of course, there are always softer strategies such as making it available but punishing yourself for following up with these time wasters, but this motivation killer often strikes when our motivation is already low, so it's very easy to justify falling into this trap unless you deliberately build a wall around it.</li>
<li><strong>Frustration:</strong> Related with stress, this motivation killer is a big one for many people. In some cases, frustration leads to stacking friction that inevitably results in giving up. However, another part of the concept of frustration is the frustration of not being able to solve a problem that causes us to prioritize it more than other things with more priority. An example of such a case that I regularly deal with is programming and debugging. I've found that when I encounter a bug, I feel obligated to fix it before I move on to whatever I do next. I always justify this behaviour in reasoning that if I don't fix this bug now, I'll forget about it later. However, I always find it interesting when I choose to take a break after discovering and not being able to fix a bug and coming back after the break to fix it really quickly. As such, frustration can motivate you...but usually for the wrong reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>For every motivator, there is a motivation killer that can negatively affect it. The best way to deal with all motivation killers is to identify them. When we identify what is hindering us from putting our best foot forward, we can step back and clear the problem instead of charging in blindly and hurting ourselves. Take the time to log a day where you end up feeling demotivated and try to isolate the factors that led to your demotivation. Once you've found out these reasons, <strong>deliberately</strong> try to tackle them. Give yourself motivation to practice this deliberation and to take down the motivation killer. It can get pretty meta, but motivation to kill a motivation killer can end up getting you much further than continuing your blind charge. If you have experienced any motivation killers that aren't listed here, feel free to email me and send me your ideas. I'd love to hear about them and help you find solutions that can help you get more done it your everyday lives!</p>
