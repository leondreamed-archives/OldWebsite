<p><em>"The only limits in your life are those that you set yourself."</em><strong> - Celestine Chua</strong></p>
<p>I'm starting to reflect on my performance for the past few weekends, and I've realized that I'm wasting 48 hours every week doing nothing. For me, weekends are motivation killers. I often rationalize that I don't need schedules on the weekend because I believe that I'm capable of managing my time...which is a very false belief. When I do try making schedules, the amount of time available during the weekend just seems ridiculously much. The issue is, the weekend has too much time that I can't find a motive for using this time well. This leads to wasted time from distractions such as YouTube, reading for fun, and sometimes just lying down on the bed, reflecting on how I'm wasting my precious weekend time. Due to this immense amount of time on the weekend, I end up not even finishing my simple tasks on Habitica because I always leave them until later to finish. This inevitably ends with me running out of time to do it after I forget the need to complete it, leading to a lot of late-night tasks I'm forced to complete which end up ruining my sleep and energy quality for the next day. In fact, I often just weasel out of doing these tasks altogether when it gets too late.</p>
<p>The WES will help me regather my use of time for the weekend because I receive the motive from doing an SSS: the motive of completing the challenge. The WES will provide me with a large goal that I need to reach. Looking back at one of the most productive periods of my life: the WBS, the 10 hour a day standard combined with the uninterrupted study sessions is what helped it succeed and provided me with an immense amount of new knowledge. When I think about how I had a ton of time during the Winter Break (in fact, much more time) than weekends when a large amount of time is a productivity killer for me, it goes to show the power and motivation an SSS can bring.</p>
<p>I've tried attempting many other SSSs after my first, but I've never succeeded. I believe one of the major reasons for my major success with the WBS is the simple fact that it was the first ever SSS I've ever tried, so the motivation to succeed was extremely great and motivated me to keep going even in times of doubt. Since the WBS, I've always had the rationale that "I've already done an SSS so I've already proved myself worthy." This mindset is toxic and will only hurt my future progress. I need a motivation that's not just about completing the SSS, but a motive for the real reason I'm doing one in the first place.</p>
<h3>My Motive</h3>
<p>I often walk to my bookshelf and stare at how full it is. I buy a ton of textbooks but don't have enough time to get through all of them. This WES is about just that: progressing through my mountain of textbooks. I find that a lot of my motivation for continuing to learn is simply by looking at the quantity of knowledge I have access to...all sitting on my bookshelf. I think that I can use this thirst of gaining knowledge to my advantage as a motive to my WES.</p>
<p>Of course, the motive of just working on textbooks isn't enough. Obviously, I'll be working on a select few and not a lot at the same time. However, it is important that I learn my lesson from one of my previous SSSs, which is to not switch between different textbooks often and end up inducing the cognitive switching penalty. After all, this challenge, at its root, is about learning.</p>
<p>Sleep is extremely important. Sadly, an exception forced me to diminish my sleeping hours from 8 to 7 (see "The Exception" section below). I plan to sleep early on Friday to be able to start at midnight/very start on Saturday. A lack of sleep has been a killer in gaining knowledge from my textbooks, so pursuing a more active style of learning instead of zombie-reading my textbooks will be more achievable with more sleep.</p>
<h3>Pre-Commitment</h3>
<p>There was an announcement on my website that announced my plans to live stream my studying. This is precommitment and gives me only two options: do the WES and meet outer expectations or give it up and disappoint. Of course, I would hate to hype something up to follow it with disappointment, so pre-commitment, for me, is an extremely powerful tool I'm using to my advantage.</p>
<p>Another pre-commitment that's important to the success of this challenge is the commitment of setup. I spent a lot of time setting up everything so that this SSS goes well, as well as planning out everything I'm going to do (including the writing of this article!).</p>
<h3>A bonus of going live</h3>
<p>With Twitch and live streaming, you never know when someone's watching if you don't look at the stats. And that's exactly what I plan to do. This almost forces me to stay on task because I'll never know if somebody will catch me wasting time (in which case I've failed the WES and I've disappointed). This also means that I can't do the things I would usually do such as opening my email, checking my website stats and wasting time looking up other things when I shouldn't be.</p>
<h3>The Exception</h3>
<p>Today is Friday, May 17, 2019. One day before my plans for this WES, a great exception pops up. It's none other than my school who assigned me a project due the day right after my WES. I'm pretty mad because it was so unexpected and now I need to reallocate time so I can get this finished. I think my plan is to stick with the WES and stop when I reach 30 hours. Then, I can spend the remaining time of my WES to finish this project and hopefully have enough time to put a decent amount of effort into it.</p>

<h3>My (New) Plan</h3>
<p>
<strong>Saturday:</strong> 12AM - 7PM<br/>
<strong>Sunday:</strong> 2AM - 8PM<br/>
<strong>Monday:</strong> 3AM - 12AM (on Tuesday, may end early)<br/>
</p>
<p>Sadly, after hearing that I have a project due on Tuesday, I think I'll have to resort to 7 hours of sleep, which may or not be a terrible idea that compromises the whole WES altogether. With this new schedule, I have 19 hours on Saturday, 18 hours on Sunday, and a maximum of 21 hours on Monday.</p>
<h3>Time allocations</h3>
<h4>Saturday - 19 hours</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>Piano - 2 hours</li>
<li>Monthly Challenge - 20 mins</li>
<li>Eating - 1 hour</li>
<li>...Leaving 15 hours 40 minutes</li>
</ul></p>
<h4>Sunday - 18 hours</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>Piano - 2 hours 45 mins</li>
<li>Monthly Challenge - 20 mins</li>
<li>Eating - 1 hour</li>
<li>Others - 1 hour 30 mins</li>
<li>...Leaving 12 hours 25 minutes</li>
</ul></p>
<h4>Monday - 21 hours</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>Piano - 2 hours</li>
<li>Eating - 1 hour</li>
<li>Monthly Challenge - 20 mins</li>
<li>...Leaving 17 hours 40 minutes</li>
</ul></p>
<p>These numbers total up to 45 hours 45 minutes that I can work with. This is how much time I have to get 30 hours of work done. This also includes fitting in exceptions (such as my project, but more prominent may be the need for breaks and making up for the lack of sleep).</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>I'm doing this WES in a room different than the one I usually work in (or waste in, to be more accurate). This simple room just contains a desk with my laptop (and my laptop accessories), a small bookshelf (which holds the textbooks I want to work through), a recording setup (for streaming) and a pile of mattresses (for sleeping). I'm concerned for my health related to my posture (which is why I'm thinking about buying a standing desk/a desk with adjustable height).</p>
<h3>Other things to keep in mind</h3>
<p>My schedule asks for me to wake up and sleep at some extreme times (waking up and sleeping <em>extremely early,</em> to be exact). I'll have to try my best to make as little noise as possible so I don't wake others up (this includes my alarm!). I also need to make sure that my stream goes well (i.e. it doesn't fail, my phone's charger doesn't get disconnected, somebody doesn't call me in the middle of the stream, etc.). I also don't want to fall asleep in the stream (that would be pretty embarrassing), and I also want to make sure that my head doesn't block the content (and I would like it to stay out of the stream as much as possible). However, even with these setbacks that live streaming provides, I still strongly believe that it is an extremely powerful tool and the benefits it provides far outweigh the extra management and effort I need to put in.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Even though my motive is to get my work done with this WES, I don't think that I'm the only one capable of doing such a thing. I don't think I have some special gene that makes me more successful in doing these extremes and I believe that everyone can do something similar to my idea of a super study session. The big issue is, society isn't as keen as learning as it once was. Social media has taken over and has dragged heads into a world where they don't really get much done. Society has marketed weekends as 'getaway time,' and the WES aims to change that mentality. I believe the weekends should be a time where we ought to learn more than what school limits and to push our efforts and motives beyond just getting a good mark. The WES has potential, not just for me, but for anyone who seeks to become much more than they once will have been.</p>
