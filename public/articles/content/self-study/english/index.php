<p>If you&rsquo;ve read my &ldquo;About Me,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll know that I absolutely love learning things on my own. I find that school is either too fast or too slow for most people, whereas learning on your own allows you to move at a pace you&rsquo;re comfortable with. I&rsquo;ve recently encountered the benefits of self-education after the WBC, where I had spent 168 hours on learning C++. Now, I can build applications that I never would&rsquo;ve imagined I could do a month before.</p>
<p>However, I do understand that there a multitude of downsides to this type of learning. The most common issue is time. I can understand how school leaves you with minimal time to study other topics, but even an hour a day on a subject can allow you to learn the subject at the rate of a full-time student. Considering most of us are wasting time when we have free time available, I think it shouldn&rsquo;t be too much of a sacrifice to leave an hour of a day to learn something you want to learn. I think it&rsquo;s more effective to learn a bit every day instead of cramming everything into one major study session and not touching it for a while, for the brain tends to remember more when the topic is evenly spread throughout frequent sessions.</p>
<p>If you find that you don&rsquo;t have an hour every day or if you can&rsquo;t manage a consistent study schedule, you can try to make the most out of your day. For example, instead of scrolling through Instagram while you&rsquo;re on the bus, you could use that time as review and recall what you&rsquo;ve learned, so that getting back into the work state of study will be easier later on. If you have free time at school, you should use that time to get your homework done, so you will end up with more time to learn in a more optimal place. If you can, try strategically planning out your day such that your quality of sleep will balance out the quantity (e.g. making sure you avoid screen time before bed, not drinking coffee too close to bedtime, etc.), so that you can have more time to study to replace the sleep you need to make up for its poor quality. I&rsquo;m sure there are a lot more ways to get more time out of your day, so you shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about it as long as you use your available time wisely.</p>
<p>Another issue I get with self study is finding out where to start. Formal education already does this for you, and in this case, they&rsquo;ve already done the hard part of making a track for you to follow, whereas with self study, you need to either create your own path or find one. The former takes more preparation and work, for you will need to consult reliable sources and put them into your own course for yourself, whereas finding a path can be as easy as using a textbook that suits your needs. For large-scale self study challenges, like the MIT Challenge by Scott Young, a mere textbook may not be enough, and time and effort must be spent on, not learning directly, but rather making sure the learning process stays smooth and consistent. However, for the most part, using textbooks or learning online in a structured manner would be enough.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you don&rsquo;t like reading books online. As well, most books aren&rsquo;t free, which raises a potential concern. As self-study is known to be cheap, there&rsquo;s a large amount of people that want to pay as little as they can while simultaneously learning as much as they can. The best way for textbooks is borrowing them from a library, which only costs you the late return fee (again, if you&rsquo;re like me). However, not everybody is content with this idea, especially those who can&rsquo;t find good books for their subject at the library, or those who prefer a copy they want to own and perhaps use possession to their advantage. For those people, second-hand textbooks are another route to go. The main downside to this approach, however, is that many of these textbooks are outdated, so you&rsquo;ll need to be extra careful to purchase books that are still fairly relevant for you (again, this may not be an issue for topics that don&rsquo;t frequently change, but if you&rsquo;re studying something like programming, it&rsquo;s recommended to get the latest so you don&rsquo;t drown in old code and bad/deprecated practices). There are many simple ways to find these books, such as the alerts feature on Kijiji, or buying second-hand (used) textbooks on Amazon, or even finding a friend who may have the textbook (or even a similar one) that you require.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <p>With self-study comes responsibility. Schools exist to make sure you never drift off the path, but they don&rsquo;t make it easy to go too far, either. As such, it&rsquo;s your job to make sure that your self-study is consistent, and make sure that when you do try to run instead of walk, that you do it in a safe way that doesn&rsquo;t hinder your progress in learning the material. Dedication is a key word here. If you aren&rsquo;t going to be dedicated to learning on your own, it&rsquo;s not going to benefit you much, as you will find yourself often forgetting the material and end up losing interest in self-study. It&rsquo;s very important to make sure that you really want to learn, and that you stick with it, or self-study can end up being a waste of time that you&rsquo;ll never get back.</p>
