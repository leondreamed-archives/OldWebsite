<p>What is an efficientist? Well, before I dive into the explanation of this term, it&rsquo;s best to start from the beginning of its creation.</p>
<p>Efficiency came to me through finding answers to the questions people ask me about the things I normally do in my everyday life that not many people choose to do, such as learning obscure things in my free time (Gregg Shorthand), blocking a load of time-wasting websites (including YouTube!) and doing questionable things to the average person (...taking <em>cold</em> showers).</p>
<p>As I reflected on these questions and searched for an answer for each, I began to realize that all these answers all shared a similar response; the reason behind all of them was to make my life more efficient.</p>
<p>As I reflected on the term &lsquo;efficiency,&rsquo; I began to realize that there&rsquo;s a blur between &lsquo;efficient&rsquo; and &lsquo;productive.&rsquo; These two definitions come from Merriam-Webster:
<p><strong>Efficient:</strong> <em>capable of producing desired results with little or no waste (as of time or materials)</em></p>
<p><strong>Productive:</strong> <em>having the quality or power of producing especially in abundance</em></p>
<p>Reflecting on the definition alone, we find that efficiency is focused on reaching your goal without wasting time, while productivity is focused on getting the most of your work. I believe that these two terms are the strongest when combined. Efficiency without productivity creates sloppy work. Productivity without efficiency creates wasted time. Combine the two, and you get value from your work as well as more time to do other things.</p>
<p>So...why do I refer to myself as an efficientist? Well, first off, just because the name doesn&rsquo;t have &lsquo;productivity&rsquo; in it doesn&rsquo;t mean that I don&rsquo;t value productivity. I think that both need each other to produce the best outcome from your labour. That being said, I&rsquo;ve come to realize that I love getting things done fast, and always love coming up with ways of how I can use my time better so that I have more time to focus on the things that need more time and attention. I love learning a lot of things, and I simply can&rsquo;t focus on only one thing, and this requires a lot of my time. With school eating up pretty much half of my time in a day, I have to find ways to become efficient in learning all that I want to learn. Hence, I like to consider myself an &lsquo;efficientist,&rsquo; one who always strives to find ways to save time (or waste less). Do you know anybody that you would consider an &lsquo;efficientist?&rsquo;</p>
